# Jmeter-load-test
**🧪 JMeter Load Testing:**
**Amazon Performance**
This project automates performance/load testing for Amazon-like workflows using Apache JMeter and GitHub Actions.
It executes a test plan (amazon-performance.jmx), generates an HTML performance report, and publishes it to GitHub Pages under date-based folders.
